Learn to develop cloud-native programs with Go!

## Review Me

One of the main steps in learning new language and its best practices is reviewing
written projects:

- <https://github.com/1995parham/koochooloo>:

  - In the first step, you need to review the project structure and find out how modules are related
  - Then we continue with running the docker-compose to have the requirements
  - And in the final step, we lunch the application and trying it with curl based on its swagger
  - This project use zap as a logger and pass it into its modules also each module
    has its metrics based on [otel](https://github.com/open-telemetry/).

- <https://github.com/1995parham/fandogh>:

  - This example containing the migration and how we store things on the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database.

- <https://github.com/1995parham/saf>:

  - This example shows tracing in action with [NATS](https://nats.io/) as a message queue.
  - Also, We can use profiler to see how replacing [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) with [GoFiber](https://gofiber.io/) increase the performance.
  - This project has Helm chart and after knowing Kubernetes basis we can lunch it on the cloud with its Helm.

- <https://github.com/1995parham/k1s>:
  - In the first step, we review the server structure. The server is stateless and only returns simple responses.
  - We it on the cloud with its manifests
  - using server and ingress to send requests and see how they distributed between instances
  - We also see how we can mount configuration on Kubernetes with [configmap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/).
