- The GoLang concepts [Structures]


* The Go programming language

- Modern
- Compact, concise, general-purpose
- Imperative, statically type-checked, dynamically type-safe
- Garbage-collected
- Opinionated, no warnings, unused local vars and imports are an error

The `new()` built-in function creates a new integer and returns a pointer to it.

* Prime, or Not Prime
.play src/prime.go

* The GoLang concepts [Functions]
.play src/functions.go

* The GoLang concepts [Structures]
.play src/structures.go
- C Structures :D
- Data hiding
- `S1`, `S2`, `S3` are public and can be accessed from anywhere.
- `private` is private and is only visible to code in the same package.

* The GoLang concepts [Methods]
.play src/methods.go

* The GoLang concepts [Interfaces]
.code src/interfaces.go

* Analytic geometry !
Let's write some code
- Create Point Interface
- Create CatesianPoint Structure
- Create PolarPoint Structure

* Analytic geometry !
